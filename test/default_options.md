## Options used to generate this readme file
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

```js
readme_generator: {
  default_options: {
    options: {
      output: "test/default_options.md",
      readme_folder: "test/readme",
      changelog_folder: "test/changelogs"
    },
    order: {
      "installation.md": "Installation",
      "usage.md": "Usage",
      "options.md": "Options",
      "example.md": "Example",
      "output.md": "Example Output",
      "building-and-testing.md": "Building and Testing",
      "legal.md": "Legal Mambo Jambo"
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

- via npm

```shell
npm install coffee-init
```

- Manually

```shell
git clone git://github.com/nox/coffee-init.git
```

## Usage
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

```javascript
var coffee_init = require('coffee-init');
coffee_init.awesome(); // "awesome"
```

If the output's line is more than the maximum bytes, then the rest of the characters will be treated as if it's in the next line. Meaning that you can find a very long line split into two in the `output` array key. Right now the max char limit is `16384` bytes.


## Options
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

- `chained`: `bool`

  `chained`, which is `true` by default, is an option that can stop running commands after one of them failed. To see if it failed, it checks the exit code of the command that is run.

- `returnOutput`: `bool`

  `returnOutput` is also `true` by default. This is what returns the output in an array, parsing them line by line. I supply with this option because sometimes you might run a command that only returns server's IP address or sometimes you can run a command that just outputs very long lines and a very long text. I added the ability to opt out so that when unnecessary you might set it to false.

## Example
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

```js
//require the extension/module/wtv
var execxi = require("execxi");

// I just defined some commands here
// These will run for a long time. So you can see that outputs are occurring in real-time.
var long_commands = ["find ~/"];
// These are just some shell scripts that exit with different exit codes
// one exits with 0, other exists with 1, and lastly 2.
var exit_codes = ["./tests/exit_0.sh","./tests/exit_1.sh","./tests/exit_2.sh"];
// this is non existent command to see what happens when it doesn't find the command to run.
// returns 127 exit code.
var non_existent = ["./tests/sadf.sh"];
// this is just a command that echoes one line, 5000 bytes.
var long_text = ["./tests/echo_bytes_5000.sh"];
// some regular commands that run successfully
var regular = Array("ls","echo \"Works\"", "ls -lart");


```

## Example Output
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

That example outputs something long like this:

```
Some Output
Coming Soon
```


## Building and Testing
[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

I have packaged a `Makefile`, `Gruntfile` for building and testing, and `npm` scripts point to those.

Available commands are:

- `make` (Aliases: `npm run-script preinstall`) : 
  Compiles the C++ code into node extension.

- `make clean` (Aliases: `npm run-script preuninstall`):
  Removes the `build` directory.

- `node test` (Aliases: `make test`) : 
  This is for visual testing rather than unit testing. 

- `grunt test`  (Aliases: `grunt`; `npm test`): 
  This is for unit testing.
